# Indy Tails Server

An Indy Tails Server is file server that is designed to receive, store and serve
Hyperledger Indy Tails files. An Indy Tails Server is commonly used by issuers
of Indy AnonCred verifiable credentials, particularly those that issued using
[Aries Cloud Agent Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python).

## Introduction

An Indy Tails Server is file server that is designed to receive, store and serve
Hyperledger Indy Tails files. Indy tails files are generated by an issuer of
Indy AnonCred verifiable credentials when a Revocation Registry is created and
must be published to a location accessible by all holders that receive a credential
referenced in that Revocation Registry. The generated file is static, it does not
change, and the credential holders use the tails file to produce a zero-knowledge
proof of non-revocation about their credential and include it when responding to
a proof request with a proof that includes claims from a revocable credential. If
you are new to Indy AnonCreds Revocation, please review
[this document](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/main/text/0011-cred-revocation) to understand
how Indy revocation works, and where tails files fit in.

An Indy Tails Server is a customized file server that makes it easy for AnonCred
Issuers to publish tails files and for holders to access those tails files. A tails
file does not have to be published to an Indy Tails Server, they can be published
anywhere as long as there exists a URL accessible to all holders to access the tails
file. If holders are mobile iOS or Android apps, the URL must use SSL (e.g. must be
`https:`) due to the restrictions in those OS's. Support for publishing tails files
to an Indy Tails Server is built into
[Aries Cloud Agent Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python).

### Metrics about Tails Files

The following are some metrics about the size of Indy tails files. When
an issuer creates a Revocation Registry, they give it a size corresponding
to the number of Indy AnonCred credentials that can be issued from the Registry.
The size of tails file grows linearly with the number of credentials in the
Registry, and that size is a limiting factor on how big a Registry can be. If
too large, the holders will have challenges in downloading and processing the
tails file.

| Revocation Registry Size | Tail File Size | Proof Generation Time |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 3000 | 768KB | ~4sec |
| 10000 | 2.6MB | ~5sec |
| 32768 | 8.4MB | ~7sec |

- Tests of Proof Generation used the Lissi-Wallet on a iPhone 12Pro
- 32768 is the Revocation Registry max-size-value set in Aries Cloud Agent Python.

## Running in Docker (easy mode)

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

From the docker directory in this repo, run `./manage start`.

## Running on Bare Metal

Install the python package `tails-server` from this directory. This may be available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) some day.

```bash
pip3 install -e .
```

Run the software:

```bash
tails-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6543 --storage-path $STORAGE_PATH
```

Where `$STORAGE_PATH` is where you would like the tails files stored.

## Usage

This server has two functions:

- Uploading a tails file
- Downloading a tails file

### Uploading

To upload a tails file, make a `PUT` request to `/{revoc_reg_id}` as a multipart file upload with 2 fields. The **first** field _must_ be named `genesis` and the **second** field _must_ be named `tails`. `genesis` should be the genesis transactions file and `tails` should be the tails file. The server supports chunked encoding for streaming very large tails files.

The server will lookup the relevant revocation registry definition and check the integrity of the file against `fileHash` on the ledger. If it's good, it will store the file. Otherwise it will respond with response code `400`. If `revoc_reg_id` does not exist on the ledger, the server will respond with response code `404`. If the file already exists on the server, it will respond with response code `409`.

### Downloading

A simple `GET` request will download a tails file. The path is `/{revoc_reg_id}` where `revoc_reg_id` is a valid id. If it doesn't exist, the server will respond with response code `404`.

## Guarantees

This software is designed to support scaling to as many machines or processes as necessary. As long as the filesystem (perhaps a network mount) being written to support POSIX file locks, you should be good.

## Tests

There is a suite of integration tests that test some assumptions about the environment like the type of mounted file system and the ledger that is being connected to. From the docker directory, run `./manage test`.

## Additional Notes

Due to how revocation works in Indy, there is the expectation/requirement that the tails server public URL will be stable over time.
Failing to satisfy this requirement will cause failures when issuing and/or verifying credentials for which the credential definition was created/registered on an "old" tails server url.
