# 1.0.0-rc0

## August 18, 2022

1.0.0 is a breaking update to ACA-Py whose version is intended to indicate the
maturity of the implementation. The final 1.0.0 release will be Aries Interop
Profile 2.0-complete, and based on Python 3.7 or higher. The initial (rc0)
release candidate is for early adopters to provide feedback.

### Breaking Changes

As of rc0, there are no breaking updates in the release from the previous v0.7.4.
However, we know that there are some pending updates that will be breaking, hence
the bumps to the major/minor version elements.

### Categorized List of Pull Requests

In rc0, there are not a lot of new features, as the focus is on cleanup and
optimization. The biggest is the inclusion with ACA-Py of a universal resolver
interface, allowing an instance to have both local resolvers for some DID
Methods and a call out to an external universal resolver for other DID Methods.
While some work has been done on moving the default Python version beyond 3.6,
more work is still to be done on that before the final v1.0.0 release.

# 0.7.4

## June 30, 2022

> :warning: **Existing multitenant JWTs invalidated when a new JWT is
generated**: If you have a pre-existing implementation with existing Admin API
authorization JWTs, invoking the endpoint to get a JWT now invalidates the
existing JWT. Previously an identical JWT would be created. Please see this
[comment on PR \#1725](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1725#issuecomment-1096172144)
for more details.

0.7.4 is a significant release focused on stability and production deployments.
As the "patch" release number indicates, there were no breaking changes in the
Admin API, but a huge volume of updates and improvements.  Highlights of this
release include:

- A major performance and stability improvement resulting from the now
recommended use of [Aries Askar](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-askar) instead
of the Indy-SDK.
- There are significant improvements and tools for dealing with
revocation-related issues.
- A lot of work has been on the handling of Hyperledger Indy transaction
endorsements.
- ACA-Py now has a pluggable persistent queues mechanism in place, with Redis
and Kafka support available (albeit with work still to come on documentation).

In addition, there are a significant number of general enhancements, bug fixes,
documentation updates and code management improvements.

This release is a reflection of the many groups stressing ACA-Py in production
environments, reporting issues and the resulting solutions. We also have a very
large number of contributors to ACA-Py, with this release having PRs from 22
different individuals. A big thank you to all of those using ACA-Py, raising
issues and providing solutions.

### Major Enhancements

A lot of work has been put into this release related to performance and load
testing, with significant updates being made to the key "shared component"
ACA-Py dependencies ([Aries Askar](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-askar), [Indy
VDR](https://github.comyperledger/indy-vdr)) and [Indy Shared RS (including
CredX)](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs). We now recommend using
those components (by using `--wallet-type askar` in the ACA-Py startup
parameters) for new ACA-Py deployments. A wallet migration tool from indy-sdk
storage to Askar storage is still needed before migrating existing deployment to
Askar. A big thanks to those creating/reporting on stress test scenarios, and
especially the team at LISSI for creating the
[aries-cloudagent-loadgenerator](https://github.com/lissi-id/aries-cloudagent-loadgenerator)
to make load testing so easy! And of course to the core ACA-Py team for
addressing the findings.

The largest enhancement is in the area of the endorsing of Hyperledger Indy
ledger transactions, enabling an instance of ACA-Py to act as an Endorser for
Indy authors needing endorsements to write objects to an Indy ledger. We're
working on an [Aries Endorser
Service](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-endorser-service) based on the new
capabilities in ACA-Py, an Endorser to be easily operated by an organization,
ideally with a controller starter kit supporting a basic human and automated
approvals business workflow. Contributions welcome!

A focus towards the end of the 0.7.4 development and release cycle was on the
handling of AnonCreds revocation in ACA-Py. Most important, a production issue
was uncovered where by an ACA-Py issuer's local Revocation Registry data could
get out of sync with what was published on an Indy ledger, resulting in an
inability to publish new RevRegEntry transactions -- making new revocations
impossible. As a result, we have added some new endpoints to enable an update to
the RevReg storage such that RevRegEntry transactions can again be published to
the ledger. Other changes were added related to revocation in general
and in the handling of tails files in particular.

The team has worked a lot on evolving the persistent queue (PQ) approach
available in ACA-Py. We have landed on a design for the queues for inbound and
outbound messages using a default in-memory implementation, and the ability to
replace the default method with implementations created via an ACA-Py plugin.
There are two concrete, out-of-the-box external persistent queuing solutions
available for [Redis](https://github.com/bcgov/aries-acapy-plugin-redis-events)
and [Kafka](https://github.com/sicpa-dlab/aries-acapy-plugin-kafka-events).
Those ACA-Py persistent queue implementation repositories will soon be migrated
to the Aries project within the Hyperledger Foundation's GitHub organization.
Anyone else can implement their own queuing plugin as long as it uses the same
interface.

Several new ways to control ACA-Py configurations were added, including new
startup parameters, Admin API parameters to control instances of protocols, and
additional web hook notifications.

A number of fixes were made to the Credential Exchange protocols, both for V1
and V2, and for both AnonCreds and W3C format VCs. Nothing new was added and
there no changes in the APIs.

As well there were a number of internal fixes, dependency updates, documentation
and demo changes, developer tools and release management updates. All the usual
stuff needed for a healthy, growing codebase.

# 0.7.3

## January 10, 2022

This release includes some new AIP 2.0 features out (Revocation Notification and
Discover Features 2.0), a major new feature for those using Indy ledger (multi-ledger support),
a new "version upgrade" process that automates updating data in secure storage required after
a new release, and a fix for a critical bug in some mediator scenarios. The release also includes several new
pieces of documentation (upgrade processing, storage database information and logging) and some other documentation
updates that make the ACA-Py [Read The Docs site](https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
useful again. And of course, some recent bug fixes and cleanups are included.

There is a **BREAKING CHANGE** for those deploying ACA-Py with an external outbound queue
implementation (see [PR #1501](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1501)).
As far as we know, there is only one organization that has such an implementation and they
were involved in the creation of this PR, so we are not making this release a minor or major update.
However, anyone else using an external queue should be aware of the impact of this PR that is
included in the release.

For those that have an existing deployment of ACA-Py with long-lasting connection records, an upgrade is needed to use
[RFC 434 Out of Band](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0434-outofband) and the "reuse connection" as the invitee. In PR #1453
(details below) a performance improvement was made when finding a connection for reuse. The new approach
(adding a tag to the connection to enable searching) applies only to connections made using this ACA-Py
release and later, and "as-is" connections made using earlier releases of ACA-Py will not be found as reuse
candidates. A new "Upgrade deployment" capability ([#1557](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1557),
described below) must be executed to update your deployment to add tags for all existing connections.

The [Supported RFCs document](/SupportedRFCs.md) has been updated to reflect the addition of the
AIP 2.0 RFCs for which support was added.

The following is an annotated list of PRs in the release, including a link to each PR.

- **AIP 2.0 Features**
  - Discover Features Protocol: v1_0 refactoring and v2_0 implementation [[#1500](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1500)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1500)
    - Updates the Discover Features 1.0 (AIP 1.0) implementation and implements the new 2.0 version. In doing so, adds generalized support for goal codes to ACA-Py.
    - fix DiscoveryExchangeRecord RECORD_TOPIC typo fix [#1566](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1566)
  - Implement Revocation Notification v1.0 [#1464](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1464)
  - Fix integration tests (revocation notifications) [#1528](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1528)
  - Add Revocation notification support to alice/faber [#1527](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1527)
- **Other New Features**
  - Multiple Indy Ledger support and State Proof verification [#1425](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1425)
    - Remove required dependencies from multi-ledger code that was requiring the import of Aries Askar even when not being used[#1550](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1550)
    - Fixed IndyDID resolver bug after Tag 0.7.3rc0 created [#1569](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1569)
    - Typo vdr service name [#1563](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1563)
    - Fixes and cleanup for multiple ledger support with Askar [#1583](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1583)
  - Outbound Queue - more usability improvements [#1501](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1501)
  - Display QR code when generating/displaying invites on startup [#1526](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1526)
  - Enable WS Pings for WS Inbound Transport [#1530](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1530)
    - Faster detection of lost Web Socket connections; implementation verified with an existing mediator.
  - Performance Improvement when using connection reuse in OOB and there are many DID connections. ConnRecord tags - their_public_did and invitation_msg_id [#1543](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1543)
    - In previous releases, a "their_public_did" was not a tag, so to see if you can reuse a connection, all connections were retrieved from the database to see if a matching public DID can be found. Now, connections created after deploying this release will have a tag on the connection such that an indexed query can be used. See "Breaking Change" note above and "Update" feature below.
    - Follow up to [#1543](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1543) - Adding invitation_msg_id and their_public_did back to record_value [#1553](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1553)
  - A generic "Upgrade Deployment" capability was added to ACA-Py that operates like a database migration capability in relational databases. When executed (via a command line option), a current version of the deployment is detected and if any storage updates need be applied to be consistent with the new version, they are, and the stored "current version"is updated to the new version. An instance of this capability can be used to address the new feature #1543 documented above. [#1557](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1557)
  - Adds a "credential_revoked" state to the Issue Credential protocol state object. When the protocol state object is retained past the completion of the protocol, it is updated when the credential is revoked. [#1545](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1545)
  - Updated a missing dependency that recently caused an error when using the `--version` command line option [#1589](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1589)
- **Critical Fixes**
  - Fix connection record response for mobile [#1469](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1469)

  - added documentation for wallet storage databases [#1523](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1523)
  - added logging documentation [#1519](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1519)
  - Fix warnings when generating ReadTheDocs [#1509](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1509)
  - Remove Streetcred references [#1504](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1504)
  - Add RTD configs to get generator working [#1496](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1496)
  - The Alice/Faber demo was updated to allow connections based on Public DIDs to be established, including reusing a connection if there is an existing connection. [#1574](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/1574)
- **Other Fixes**
  - Connection Handling / Out of Band Invitations Fixes

# 0.7.2

## November 15, 2021

A mostly maintenance release with some key updates and cleanups based on community deployments and discovery.
With usage in the field increasing, we're cleaning up edge cases and issues related to volume deployments.

The most significant new feature for users of Indy ledgers is a simplified approach for transaction authors getting their transactions
signed by an endorser. Transaction author controllers now do almost nothing other than configuring their instance to use an Endorser,
and ACA-Py takes care of the rest. Documentation of that feature is [here](Endorser.md).

# 0.6.0

## February 25, 2021

This is a significant release of ACA-Py with several new features, as well as changes to the internal architecture in order to set the groundwork for using the new shared component libraries: [indy-vdr](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr), [indy-credx](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs), and [aries-askar](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-askar).

### Mediator support

While ACA-Py had previous support for a basic routing protocol, this was never fully developed or used in practice. Starting with this release, inbound and outbound connections can be established through a mediator agent using the Aries (Mediator Coordination Protocol)[https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0211-route-coordination]. This work was initially contributed by Adam Burdett and Daniel Bluhm of [Indicio](https://indicio.tech/) on behalf of [SICPA](https://sicpa.com/). [Read more about mediation support](./Mediation.md).

### Multi-Tenancy support

Started by [BMW](https://bmw.com/) and completed by [Animo Solutions](https://animo.id/) and [Anon Solutions](https://anon-solutions.ca/) on behalf of [SICPA](https://sicpa.com/), this feature allows for a single ACA-Py instance to host multiple wallet instances. This can greatly reduce the resources required when many identities are being handled. [Read more about multi-tenancy support](./Multitenancy.md).

### New connection protocol(s)

In addition to the Aries 0160 Connections RFC, ACA-Py now supports the Aries [DID Exchange Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0023-did-exchange) for connection establishment and reuse, as well as the Aries [Out-of-Band Protocol](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0434-outofband) for representing connection invitations and other pre-connection requests.

### Issue-Credential v2

This release includes an initial implementation of the Aries [Issue Credential v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0453-issue-credential-v2) protocol.

### Notable changes for administrators

- There are several new endpoints available for controllers as well as new startup parameters related to the multi-tenancy and mediator features, see the feature description pages above in order to make use of these features. Additional admin endpoints are introduced for the DID Exchange, Issue Credential v2, and Out-of-Band protocols.

- When running `aca-py start`, a new wallet will no longer be created unless the `--auto-provision` argument is provided. It is recommended to always use `aca-py provision` to initialize the wallet rather than relying on automatic behaviour, as this removes the need for repeatedly providing the wallet seed value (if any). This is a breaking change from previous versions.

- When running `aca-py provision`, an existing wallet will not be removed and re-created unless the `--recreate-wallet` argument is provided. This is a breaking change from previous versions.

- The logic around revocation intervals has been tightened up in accordance with [Present Proof Best Practices](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0441-present-proof-best-practices).

### Notable changes for plugin writers

The following are breaking changes to the internal APIs which may impact Python code extensions.

- Manager classes generally accept a `Profile` instance, where previously they accepted a `RequestContext`.

- Admin request handlers now receive an `AdminRequestContext` as `app["context"]`. The current profile is available as `app["context"].profile`. The admin server now generates a unique context instance per request in order to facilitate multi-tenancy, rather than reusing the same instance for each handler.

- In order to inject the `BaseStorage` or `BaseWallet` interfaces, a `ProfileSession` must be used. Other interfaces can be injected at the `Profile` or `ProfileSession` level. This is obtained by awaiting `profile.session()` for the current `Profile` instance, or (preferably) using it as an async context manager:

```python=
async with profile.session() as session:
   storage = session.inject(BaseStorage)
```

- The `inject` method of a context is no longer `async`.
