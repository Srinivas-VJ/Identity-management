# Note that these tests require a ledger with TAA enabled
# you can run von-network as `./manage start --taa-sample --logs`

   Scenario Outline: accept the ledger TAA and write to the ledger
      Given we have "1" agents
         | name  | role     | capabilities        |
         | Acme  | issuer   | <Acme_capabilities> |
      And "Acme" connects to a ledger that requires acceptance of the TAA
      When "Acme" accepts the TAA
      Then "Acme" is ready to issue a credential for <Schema_name>

      Examples:
         | Acme_capabilities                      | Schema_name    |
         | --taa-accept                           | driverslicense |
         | --taa-accept --multitenant             | driverslicense |
         | --taa-accept --revocation              | driverslicense |

   Scenario Outline: accept the ledger TAA and write to the ledger via endorser

         | Acme  | endorser | <Acme_capabilities> |
         | Bob   | author   | <Bob_capabilities>  |
      And "Acme" connects to a ledger that requires acceptance of the TAA
      And "Bob" connects to a ledger that requires acceptance of the TAA
      And "Acme" and "Bob" have an existing connection
      When "Acme" accepts the TAA
      And "Bob" accepts the TAA
      And "Acme" has a DID with role "ENDORSER"
      And "Acme" connection has job role "TRANSACTION_ENDORSER"

      And "Bob" has a DID with role "AUTHOR"
      And "Bob" authors a schema transaction with <Schema_name>
      And "Bob" requests endorsement for the transaction
      And "Acme" endorses the transaction
      Then "Bob" can write the transaction to the ledger
      And "Bob" has written the schema <Schema_name> to the ledger

      Examples:
         | Acme_capabilities          | Bob_capabilities           | Schema_name    |
