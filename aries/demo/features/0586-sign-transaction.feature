   Scenario Outline: endorse a transaction and write to the ledger
      Given we have "2" agents
         | name  | role     | capabilities        |
         | Acme  | endorser | <Acme_capabilities> |
         | Bob   | author   | <Bob_capabilities>  |
      And "Acme" and "Bob" have an existing connection
      When "Acme" has a DID with role "ENDORSER"
      And "Acme" connection has job role "TRANSACTION_ENDORSER"
      And "Bob" connection has job role "TRANSACTION_AUTHOR"
      And "Bob" connection sets endorser info
      And "Bob" has a DID with role "AUTHOR"
      And "Bob" authors a schema transaction with <Schema_name>
      And "Bob" requests endorsement for the transaction
      And "Acme" endorses the transaction
      Then "Bob" can write the transaction to the ledger
      And "Bob" has written the schema <Schema_name> to the ledger

      Examples:
         | Acme_capabilities         | Bob_capabilities          | Schema_name    |
         | --did-exchange            | --did-exchange            | driverslicense |
