Aries Cloud Agent Python Code Documentation
===================================================

Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for building decentralized
identity applications and services running in non-mobile environments.

This is the Read The Docs site for the Hyperledger 
`Aries Cloud Agent Python <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python>`_.
This site contains only the ACA-Py docstrings documentation
extracted from the Python Code. For other documentation, please consult the links
in the Readme for the `ACA-Py <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python>`_
GitHub Repo.

If you are getting started with verifiable credentials or Aries,
we recommend that you start with this `verifiable credentials and agents
getting started guide
<https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/main/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev>`_.

Want to quick overview of the deployment model for ACA-Py? See 
`this document <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/deploymentModel.md>`_.

To investigate the code, use search or click the package links in the left menu to
drill into the modules, subpackages and submodules that make up ACA-Py.

Developers that are interested in what DIDComm protocols are supported in ACA-Py
should take a look at the `protocols <generated/aries_cloudagent.protocols.html>`_ package. 
These should align with the corresponding
`aries-rfcs protocols <https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features>`_.
Decorators defined in aries-rfcs and implemented in ACA-Py can be found
`here <generated/aries_cloudagent.messaging.decorators.html>`_.
Some general purpose subpackages that might be of interest include
`wallet <generated/aries_cloudagent.wallet.html>`_ and
`storage <generated/aries_cloudagent.storage.html>`_. For those
agents playing different roles in a verifiable credential exchange, take a look
at the `issuer <generated/aries_cloudagent.issuer.html>`_,
`holder <generated/aries_cloudagent.holder.html>`_ and
`verifier <generated/aries_cloudagent.verifier.html>`_ packages.

Please see the `ACA-Py Contribution guidelines 
<https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/README.md#contributing>`_
for how to contribute to ACA-Py, including for how to submit issues about ACA-Py.
